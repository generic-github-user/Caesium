# Benchmarks
[`caesium/src/versions/javascript/benchmarks`](https://github.com/generic-github-user/Caesium/tree/master/src/versions/javascript/benchmarks)

A series of short benchmark scripts used for determining the speed of different operations in the JavaScript version of the Caesium AI library. These are meant to be used for optimization purposes, especially comparing different methods of performing operations and determining which parts of the library are the most computationally expensive.

Each file contains a different benchmarking script. More information about each script can be found in the README file in that script's folder. These scripts can be executed in the browser console on a page with Caesium loaded, or as a JavaScript file embedded in a web page with the Caesium library script.
